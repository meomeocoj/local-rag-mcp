# Feature Specification: Optimized RAG Engine for Local Markdown Documents

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-rag-engine`
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "the rag engine will for my local document retrieval well and all my document is markdown."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identified: local document storage, markdown format, retrieval optimization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: "retrieval well" - what specific performance metrics?]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: document volume and size expectations]
   → [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: query patterns and user workflows]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → User flow: ingest markdown → query → retrieve relevant results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Marked ambiguous requirements with clarification tags
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → WARN "Spec has uncertainties - see clarification markers"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning after clarifications)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines

- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-06

- Q: What is the target query response time for the RAG engine? → A: Under 500ms for typical queries (up to 1000 docs)
- Q: How many top results should the system return per query? → A: Fixed at 5 results
- Q: Should the system filter out results below a relevance threshold? → A: Yes - filter results below 0.5 similarity score
- Q: Should the system support batch ingestion of multiple files? → A: Yes - accept multiple file paths in single command
- Q: How should the system handle markdown files deleted from local storage after ingestion? → A: Manual removal only - user must explicitly delete from index

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

A user has a collection of markdown documentation files stored locally on their machine. They need to quickly find relevant information across these documents by asking questions in natural language, without manually searching through each file. The system should understand the content semantically and return the most relevant sections with accurate context.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has ingested 100 markdown files into the system, **When** they query "how to configure authentication", **Then** the system returns the top 5 most relevant document sections ranked by relevance with source file references
2. **Given** a user queries the system, **When** relevant information spans multiple markdown files, **Then** the system aggregates results from all relevant sources and indicates which file each result comes from
3. **Given** a user has markdown files with code blocks and technical documentation, **When** they search for specific code examples or technical concepts, **Then** the system preserves code formatting and returns contextually complete chunks
4. **Given** a user ingests new markdown files, **When** files contain headers, lists, tables, and nested structures, **Then** the system maintains document structure and hierarchy in retrieved results
5. **Given** a user updates an existing markdown file, **When** they re-ingest the file, **Then** the system updates its index without duplicating content

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a markdown file is extremely large (>1MB)? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: maximum file size limits]
- How does the system handle malformed markdown or mixed content formats?
- What happens when a query has no relevant results in the document collection?
- How does the system handle duplicate content across multiple files?
- What happens when markdown files are deleted from local storage after ingestion? User must manually remove from index.
- How does the system handle special characters, code syntax, and non-English languages in markdown files?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST accept markdown (.md) files from local file system paths for ingestion
- **FR-002**: System MUST parse markdown files while preserving structural elements (headers, lists, code blocks, tables)
- **FR-003**: System MUST chunk markdown content intelligently at logical boundaries (sections, subsections) rather than arbitrary character limits
- **FR-004**: System MUST accept natural language queries from users
- **FR-005**: System MUST return ranked retrieval results based on semantic relevance to the query
- **FR-006**: System MUST include source file references and document positions for all retrieved chunks
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist ingested document data across sessions without requiring re-ingestion
- **FR-008**: System MUST support updating previously ingested files when content changes
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle markdown files with code blocks in various programming languages without losing formatting
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain document hierarchy and context (parent headers, section structure) in retrieved chunks
- **FR-011**: System MUST return query results within 500ms for typical queries against collections up to 1000 documents
- **FR-012**: System MUST return up to 5 top-ranked results for each query
- **FR-013**: System MUST filter out results with similarity scores below 0.5, returning fewer than 5 results if necessary
- **FR-014**: System MUST support batch ingestion by accepting multiple file paths in a single ingestion command
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide manual deletion capability, allowing users to explicitly remove documents from the index (no automatic detection of deleted source files)

### Key Entities

- **Markdown Document**: Represents a single .md file from the user's local storage, containing structured text content with headers, paragraphs, code blocks, lists, and other markdown elements
- **Document Chunk**: Represents a logically segmented portion of a markdown document, maintaining context through header hierarchy and position metadata, used as the atomic unit for retrieval
- **Query**: Represents a natural language question or search phrase submitted by the user to find relevant information
- **Retrieval Result**: Represents a ranked chunk returned in response to a query, including the chunk content, source document reference, relevance score, and positional metadata
