# Feature Specification: LangChain MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter Integration

**Feature Branch**: `002-use-langchain-markdownheadertextsplitter`
**Created**: 2025-10-07
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Use langchain MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter for chunking my documents for preserve context"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Replace current chunking with LangChain's MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: RAG system users querying documentation
   ‚Üí Actions: Chunk markdown documents while preserving context
   ‚Üí Data: Markdown documents with header hierarchies
   ‚Üí Constraints: Must preserve contextual information from headers
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What happens to existing indexed documents?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should both chunkers coexist or replace entirely?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance requirements for chunking speed?]
   ‚Üí [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Maximum chunk size constraints?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User ingests markdown ‚Üí System chunks with header context ‚Üí Queries return contextually relevant results
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Document chunks with header metadata
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí WARN: Spec has uncertainties (clarifications needed)
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for clarification phase)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-07

- Q: What should happen to existing indexed documents when the new chunking strategy is implemented? ‚Üí A: Require manual re-ingestion (user must delete old docs and re-upload)
- Q: Should the old chunking method remain available as an option, or be completely replaced? ‚Üí A: Completely replace old chunker (remove it entirely)
- Q: What should be the maximum chunk size and overlap strategy for the new chunker? ‚Üí A: Increase to 1024 chars max, 100 char overlap for better context
- Q: What should happen when a markdown document has no headers? ‚Üí A: Treat entire document as one chunk (if under 1024 chars)
- Q: What performance target should chunking meet? ‚Üí A: Maintain existing <500ms per query performance (chunking happens at ingestion, not query time)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user of the RAG system, I want my markdown documents to be chunked in a way that preserves their hierarchical context (headers, sections, subsections) so that when I query the system, the retrieved chunks contain enough contextual information to understand what section of documentation they came from, making the answers more accurate and easier to interpret.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a markdown document with multiple header levels (H1, H2, H3)
   **When** the document is ingested into the RAG system
   **Then** each chunk retains metadata about its position in the document hierarchy

2. **Given** a document section under "Configuration ‚Üí Database ‚Üí Connection Pooling"
   **When** a user queries about "connection pooling"
   **Then** the retrieved chunk clearly indicates it belongs to the Database Configuration section

3. **Given** two documents with similarly worded content but different header contexts
   **When** a user queries for specific information
   **Then** the system can distinguish between them based on their hierarchical context

4. **Given** an existing RAG system with indexed documents
   **When** the new chunking strategy is implemented
   **Then** users must manually delete old documents and re-ingest them to use the new chunking strategy

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a markdown document has no headers? (treated as single chunk if ‚â§1024 chars, otherwise split by character limit)
- How does the system handle malformed markdown with inconsistent header levels?
- What if a section under headers exceeds 1024 characters? (chunks split with 100 char overlap)
- How are code blocks, tables, and lists handled within header sections?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST chunk markdown documents while preserving hierarchical header context (e.g., H1 ‚Üí H2 ‚Üí H3 structure)

- **FR-002**: System MUST attach header hierarchy metadata to each chunk so users can understand the document structure context

- **FR-003**: System MUST display header context when presenting query results to users (e.g., "Section: Introduction ‚Üí Getting Started ‚Üí Installation")

- **FR-004**: System MUST handle markdown documents without headers by treating the entire document as a single chunk (if ‚â§1024 characters) or splitting by character limit with 100 char overlap (if >1024 characters)

- **FR-005**: System MUST require users to manually delete and re-ingest existing documents to apply the new chunking strategy (no automatic migration)

- **FR-006**: Chunks MUST have a maximum size of 1024 characters with 100 character overlap between consecutive chunks to preserve context

- **FR-007**: System MUST completely replace the old chunking method (old chunker will be removed entirely)

- **FR-008**: System MUST preserve special markdown elements (code blocks, tables, lists) within their header context without breaking them across chunks

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001**: System MUST maintain existing query performance of <500ms for collections up to 1000 documents (chunking occurs at ingestion time and does not affect query latency)

- **NFR-002**: Header context metadata MUST be efficiently stored and retrieved without significant storage overhead (leverage existing JSON metadata serialization)

### Key Entities

- **Document Chunk**: A segment of text extracted from a markdown document, containing:
  - The actual text content
  - Header hierarchy metadata (ordered list of parent headers)
  - Position information within the original document
  - Source document identifier

- **Header Hierarchy**: The structural path of headers leading to a chunk:
  - Level indicators (H1, H2, H3, etc.)
  - Header text at each level
  - Relationship to parent and sibling headers
